# Stores

You can use the `stores` folder to add your own stores.

Present by default in the folder are:

-   [`mounted.ts`](../src/lib/stores/mounted.ts): Returns `true` when `onMount` has been called.
-   [`pageTransition.ts`](../src/lib/stores/pageTransition.ts): Manages the page transition.
-   [`window/createWindowEventStore.ts`](../src/lib/stores/window/createWindowEventStore.ts): See
    [window events]('./13-window-event-listeners.md').
